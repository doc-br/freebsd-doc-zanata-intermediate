    <title xml:lang="en">What, a real <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>?</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">The BSD operating systems are not clones, but open source
      derivatives of AT&amp;T's Research <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> operating system,
      which is also the ancestor of the modern <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> System V.  This
      may surprise you.  How could that happen when AT&amp;T has never
      released its code as open source?</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">It is true that AT&amp;T <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> is not open source, and in a
      copyright sense BSD is very definitely <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, but on the other hand, AT&amp;T has imported sources
      from other projects, noticeably the Computer Sciences Research
      Group (CSRG) of the University of California in Berkeley, CA.
      Starting in 1976, the CSRG started releasing tapes of their
      software, calling them <emphasis>Berkeley Software
	Distribution</emphasis> or <emphasis>BSD</emphasis>.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">Initial BSD releases consisted mainly of user programs, but
      that changed dramatically when the CSRG landed a contract with
      the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to upgrade
      the communications protocols on their network, ARPANET.  The new
      protocols were known as the <emphasis>Internet
	Protocols</emphasis>, later <emphasis>TCP/IP</emphasis> after
      the most important protocols.  The first widely distributed
      implementation was part of 4.2BSD, in 1982.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">In the course of the 1980s, a number of new workstation
      companies sprang up.  Many preferred to license <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> rather
      than developing operating systems for themselves.  In
      particular, Sun Microsystems licensed <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and implemented a
      version of 4.2BSD, which they called <trademark>SunOS</trademark>.  When AT&amp;T
      themselves were allowed to sell <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> commercially, they
      started with a somewhat bare-bones implementation called System
      III, to be quickly followed by System V.  The System V code base
      did not include networking, so all implementations included
      additional software from the BSD, including the TCP/IP software,
      but also utilities such as the <emphasis>csh</emphasis> shell
      and the <emphasis>vi</emphasis> editor.  Collectively, these
      enhancements were known as the <emphasis>Berkeley
	Extensions</emphasis>.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">The BSD tapes contained AT&amp;T source code and thus
      required a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> source license.  By 1990, the CSRG's funding
      was running out, and it faced closure.  Some members of the
      group decided to release the BSD code, which was Open Source,
      without the AT&amp;T proprietary code.  This finally happened
      with the <emphasis>Networking Tape 2</emphasis>, usually known
      as <emphasis>Net/2</emphasis>.  Net/2 was not a complete
      operating system: about 20% of the kernel code was missing.  One
      of the CSRG members, William F. Jolitz, wrote the remaining code
      and released it in early 1992 as <emphasis>386BSD</emphasis>.
      At the same time, another group of ex-CSRG members formed a
      commercial company called <link xlink:href="http://www.bsdi.com/">Berkeley Software Design
	Inc.</link> and released a beta version of an operating system
      called <link xlink:href="http://www.bsdi.com/">BSD/386</link>,
      which was based on the same sources.  The name of the operating
      system was later changed to BSD/OS.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">386BSD never became a stable operating system.  Instead, two
      other projects split off from it in 1993: <link xlink:href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</link> and <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/index.html">FreeBSD</link>.  The two
      projects originally diverged due to differences in patience
      waiting for improvements to 386BSD: the NetBSD people started
      early in the year, and the first version of FreeBSD was not
      ready until the end of the year.  In the meantime, the code base
      had diverged sufficiently to make it difficult to merge.  In
      addition, the projects had different aims, as we will see below.
      In 1996, <link xlink:href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/">OpenBSD</link> split off
      from NetBSD, and in 2003, <link xlink:href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/">DragonFlyBSD</link>
      split off from FreeBSD.</para>

    <title xml:lang="en">Why is BSD not better known?</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">For a number of reasons, BSD is relatively unknown:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">The BSD developers are often more interested in
	  polishing their code than marketing it.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Much of Linux's popularity is due to factors external to
	  the Linux projects, such as the press, and to companies
	  formed to provide Linux services.  Until recently, the open
	  source BSDs had no such proponents.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">In 1992, AT&amp;T sued <link xlink:href="http://www.bsdi.com/">BSDI</link>, the vendor
	  of BSD/386, alleging that the product contained
	  AT&amp;T-copyrighted code.  The case was settled out of
	  court in 1994, but the spectre of the litigation continues
	  to haunt people.  In March 2000 an article published on the
	  web claimed that the court case had been <quote>recently
	    settled</quote>.</para>

	<para xml:lang="en">One detail that the lawsuit did clarify is the naming:
	  in the 1980s, BSD was known as <quote>BSD <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark></quote>.
	  With the elimination of the last vestige of AT&amp;T code
	  from BSD, it also lost the right to the name <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>.  Thus
	  you will see references in book titles to <quote>the 4.3BSD
	    <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> operating system</quote> and <quote>the 4.4BSD

    <title xml:lang="en">Comparing BSD and Linux</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">So what is really the difference between, say, Debian Linux
      and FreeBSD?  For the average user, the difference is
      surprisingly small: Both are <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> like operating systems.
      Both are developed by non-commercial projects (this does not
      apply to many other Linux distributions, of course).  In the
      following section, we will look at BSD and compare it to Linux.
      The description applies most closely to FreeBSD, which accounts
      for an estimated 80% of the BSD installations, but the
      differences from NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD are
      small.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title xml:lang="en">Who owns BSD?</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">No one person or corporation owns BSD. It is created and
	distributed by a community of highly technical and committed
	contributors all over the world.  Some of the components of
	BSD are Open Source projects in their own right and managed by
	different project maintainers.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title xml:lang="en">How is BSD developed and updated?</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">The BSD kernels are developed and updated following the
	Open Source development model.  Each project maintains a
	publicly accessible <emphasis>source tree</emphasis> which
	contains all source files for the project, including
	documentation and other incidental files.  Users can obtain a
	complete copy of any version.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">A large number of developers worldwide contribute to
	improvements to BSD.  They are divided into three
	kinds:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en"><firstterm>Contributors</firstterm> write code or
	    documentation.  They are not permitted to commit (add
	    code) directly to the source tree.  In order for their
	    code to be included in the system, it must be reviewed and
	    checked in by a registered developer, known as a
	    <emphasis>committer</emphasis>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en"><firstterm>Committers</firstterm> are developers with
	    write access to the source tree.  In order to become a
	    committer, an individual must show ability in the area in
	    which they are active.</para>

	  <para xml:lang="en">It is at the individual committer's discretion whether
	    they should obtain authority before committing changes to
	    the source tree.  In general, an experienced committer may
	    make changes which are obviously correct without obtaining
	    consensus.  For example, a documentation project committer
	    may correct typographical or grammatical errors without
	    review.  On the other hand, developers making far-reaching
	    or complicated changes are expected to submit their
	    changes for review before committing them.  In extreme
	    cases, a core team member with a function such as
	    Principal Architect may order that changes be removed from
	    the tree, a process known as <firstterm>backing
	      out</firstterm>.  All committers receive mail describing
	    each individual commit, so it is not possible to commit
	    secretly.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">The <firstterm>Core team</firstterm>.  FreeBSD and
	    NetBSD each have a core team which manages the project.
	    The core teams developed in the course of the projects,
	    and their role is not always well-defined.  It is not
	    necessary to be a developer in order to be a core team
	    member, though it is normal.  The rules for the core team
	    vary from one project to the other, but in general they
	    have more say in the direction of the project than
	    non-core team members have.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">This arrangement differs from Linux in a number of
	ways:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">No one person controls the content of the system.  In
	    practice, this difference is overrated, since the
	    Principal Architect can require that code be backed out,
	    and even in the Linux project several people are permitted
	    to make changes.</para>

	license?</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">Linux is available under the <link xlink:href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
	  General Public License</link> (GPL), which is designed to
	eliminate closed source software.  In particular, any
	derivative work of a product released under the GPL must also
	be supplied with source code if requested.  By contrast, the
	<link xlink:href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD
	  license</link> is less restrictive: binary-only
	distributions are allowed.  This is particularly attractive
	for embedded applications.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title xml:lang="en">What else should I know?</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">Since fewer applications are available for BSD than Linux,
	the BSD developers created a Linux compatibility package,
	which allows Linux programs to run under BSD.  The package
	includes both kernel modifications, in order to correctly
	perform Linux system calls, and Linux compatibility files such
	as the C library.  There is no noticeable difference in
	execution speed between a Linux application running on a Linux
	machine and a Linux application running on a BSD machine of
	the same speed.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">The <quote>all from one supplier</quote> nature of BSD
	means that upgrades are much easier to handle than is
	frequently the case with Linux.  BSD handles library version
	upgrades by providing compatibility modules for earlier
	library versions, so it is possible to run binaries which are
	several years old with no problems.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">What does this all mean in practice?  Who should use BSD,
	who should use Linux?</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">This is a very difficult question to answer.  Here are
	some guidelines:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en"><quote>If it ain't broke, don't fix it</quote>: If you
	    already use an open source operating system, and you are
	    happy with it, there is probably no good reason to
	    change.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">BSD systems, in particular FreeBSD, can have notably
	    higher performance than Linux.  But this is not across the
	    board.  In many cases, there is little or no difference in
	    performance.  In some cases, Linux may perform better than
	    FreeBSD.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">In general, BSD systems have a better reputation for
	    reliability, mainly as a result of the more mature code
	    base.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">BSD projects have a better reputation for the quality
	    and completeness of their documentation.  The various
	    documentation projects aim to provide actively updated
	    documentation, in many languages, and covering all aspects
	    of the system.</para>

	    GPL.</para> </listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para xml:lang="en">BSD can execute most Linux binaries, while Linux can
	    not execute BSD binaries.  Many BSD implementations can
	    also execute binaries from other <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> like systems.  As

	    other systems than Linux would.</para>
