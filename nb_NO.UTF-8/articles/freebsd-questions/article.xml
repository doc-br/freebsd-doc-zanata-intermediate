    <title xml:id="Introduction" xml:lang="en">Introduction</title>

    <para xml:lang="en"><literal>FreeBSD-questions</literal> is a mailing list maintained by
      the FreeBSD project to help people who have questions about the normal
      use of FreeBSD.  Another group, <literal>FreeBSD-hackers</literal>,
      discusses more advanced questions such as future development
      work.</para>

    <note>
      <para xml:lang="en">The term <quote>hacker</quote> has nothing to do with breaking
	into other people's computers.  The correct term for the latter
	activity is <quote>cracker</quote>, but the popular press has not found
	out yet.  The FreeBSD hackers disapprove strongly of cracking
	security, and have nothing to do with it.  For a longer description of
	hackers, see Eric Raymond's <link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become
	A Hacker</link></para>
    </note>

    <para xml:lang="en">This is a regular posting aimed to help both those seeking advice
      from FreeBSD-questions (the <quote>newcomers</quote>), and also those
      who answer the questions (the <quote>hackers</quote>).</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">Inevitably there is some friction, which stems from the different
      viewpoints of the two groups.  The newcomers accuse the hackers of being
      arrogant, stuck-up, and unhelpful, while the hackers accuse the
      newcomers of being stupid, unable to read plain English, and expecting
      everything to be handed to them on a silver platter.  Of course, there is
      an element of truth in both these claims, but for the most part these
      viewpoints come from a sense of frustration.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">In this document, I would like to do something to relieve this
      frustration and help everybody get better results from
      FreeBSD-questions.  In the following section, I recommend how to submit
      a question; after that, we will look at how to answer one.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">When you subscribed to FreeBSD-questions, you got a welcome message

    <literallayout class="monospaced" xml:lang="en">Welcome to the freebsd-questions@freebsd.org mailing list!

To post to this list, send your email to:

  freebsd-questions@freebsd.org

General information about the mailing list is at:

  https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-questions

If you ever want to unsubscribe or change your options (e.g., switch to
or from digest mode, change your password, etc.), visit your
subscription page at:

https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/options/freebsd-questions/grog%40lemsi.de

You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:

  freebsd-questions-request@freebsd.org

with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.

You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  It is:

  12345

Normally, Mailman will remind you of your freebsd.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.</literallayout>

    <title xml:id="submit" xml:lang="en">How to submit a question</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">When submitting a question to FreeBSD-questions, consider the
      following points:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a FreeBSD
	  question. They do it of their own free will.  You can influence this
	  free will positively by submitting a well-formulated question
	  supplying as much relevant information as possible.  You can
	  influence this free will negatively by submitting an incomplete,
	  illegible, or rude question. It is perfectly possible to send a
	  message to FreeBSD-questions and not get an answer even if you
	  follow these rules.  It is much more possible to not get an answer if
	  you do not.  In the rest of this document, we will look at how to get
	  the most out of your question to FreeBSD-questions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Not everybody who answers FreeBSD questions reads every message:
	  they look at the subject line and decide whether it interests them.
	  Clearly, it is in your interest to specify a subject. <quote>FreeBSD
	  problem</quote> or <quote>Help</quote> are not enough.  If you provide no subject at
	  all, many people will not bother reading it.  If your subject is not
	  specific enough, the people who can answer it may not read
	  it.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Format your message so that it is	legible, and
	    PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT!!!!!.  We appreciate that a lot of people do not
	    speak English as their first language, and we try to make
	    allowances for that, but it is really painful to try to read a
	    message written full of typos or without any line breaks.</para>

	<para xml:lang="en">Do not underestimate the effect that a poorly formatted mail
	  message has, not just on the FreeBSD-questions mailing list.
	  Your mail message is all people see of you, and if it is poorly
	  formatted, one line per paragraph, badly spelt, or full of
	  errors, it will give people a poor impression of you.</para>

	<para xml:lang="en">A lot of badly formatted messages come from
	  <link xlink:href="http://www.lemis.com/email.html">bad mailers or badly
	  configured mailers</link>.  The following mailers are known to

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly.  This may

	  of the people you are trying to reach get several hundred messages a

	  date, and if your message does not come before the first answer, they
	  may assume they missed it and not bother to look.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para xml:lang="en">Do not include unrelated questions in the same message.  Firstly,
