	may be consumed.  Also keep in mind that
	<emphasis>official</emphasis> mirrors are probably required to
	be complete.  The web pages should always be mirrored
	completely.  Also note that the numbers stated here are
	reflecting the current state (at
	10.4-RELEASE/12.0-RELEASE).  Further
	development and releases will only increase the required
	amount.  Also make sure to keep some (ca. 10-20%) extra space

      <para xml:lang="en">Of course, you need to be connected to the Internet.  The
	required bandwidth depends on your intended use of the mirror.
	If you just want to mirror some parts of FreeBSD for local use
	at your site/intranet, the demand may be much smaller than if
	you want to make the files publicly available.  If you intend
	to become an official mirror, the bandwidth required will be
	even higher.  We can only give rough estimates here:</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-system">
      <title xml:lang="en">System Requirements, CPU, RAM</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">One thing this depends on the expected number of clients,
	which is determined by the server's policy.  It is also
	affected by the types of services you want to offer.  Plain
	FTP or HTTP services may not require a huge amount of
	resources.  Watch out if you provide rsync.  This can have a
	huge impact on CPU and memory requirements as it is considered
	a memory hog.  The following are just examples to give you a
	very rough hint.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">For a moderately visited site that offers
	<application>rsync</application>, you might consider a current
	CPU with around 800MHz - 1 GHz, and at least 512MB RAM. This
	is probably the minimum you want for an
	<emphasis>official</emphasis> site.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">For a frequently used site you definitely need more RAM
	(consider 2GB as a good start) and possibly more CPU, which
	could also mean that you need to go for a SMP system.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">You also want to consider a fast disk subsystem.
	Operations on the SVN repository require a fast disk subsystem
	(RAID is highly advised).  A SCSI controller that has a cache
	of its own can also speed up things since most of these
	services incur a large number of small modifications to the
	disk.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">Ok, now you know the requirements and how to offer the
      services, but not how to get it.  :-) This section explains how
      to actually mirror the various parts of FreeBSD, what tools to
      use, and where to mirror from.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-ftp-rsync">
      <title xml:lang="en">Mirroring the FTP Site</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">The FTP area is the largest amount of data that needs to
	be mirrored.  It includes the <emphasis>distribution
	  sets</emphasis> required for network installation, the
	<emphasis>branches</emphasis> which are actually snapshots of
	checked-out source trees, the <emphasis>ISO Images</emphasis>
	to write CD-ROMs with the installation distribution, a live
	file system, and a snapshot of the ports tree.  All of course
	for various FreeBSD versions, and various
	architectures.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">The best way to mirror the FTP area is
	<application>rsync</application>.  You can install the port
	<package>net/rsync</package> and then use rsync to sync with
	your upstream host.  <application>rsync</application> is
	already mentioned in <xref linkend="mirror-serv-rsync"/>.
	Since <application>rsync</application> access is not required,
	your preferred upstream site may not allow it.  You may need
	to hunt around a little bit to find a site that allows
	<application>rsync</application> access.</para>

      <note>
	<para xml:lang="en">Since the number of <application>rsync</application>
	  clients will have a significant impact on the server
	  machine, most admins impose limitations on their server.
	  For a mirror, you should ask the site maintainer you are
	  syncing from about their policy, and maybe an exception for
	  your host (since you are a mirror).</para>

    <title xml:lang="en">Where to Mirror From</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">This is an important issue.  So this section will spend some
      effort to explain the backgrounds.  We will say this several
      times: under no circumstances should you mirror from <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="mirror-where-organization">
      <title xml:lang="en">A few Words About the Organization</title>

      <para xml:lang="en">Mirrors are organized by country.  All official mirrors
	have a DNS entry of the form <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftpN.CC.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>.
	<emphasis>CC</emphasis> (i.e., country code) is the
	<emphasis>top level domain</emphasis> (TLD) of the country
	where this mirror is located.  <emphasis>N</emphasis> is a
	number, telling that the host would be the
	<emphasis>Nth</emphasis> mirror in that country.  (Same
	applies to <systemitem>wwwN.CC.FreeBSD.org</systemitem>, etc.)
	There are mirrors with no <emphasis>CC</emphasis> part.  These
	are the mirror sites that are very well connected and allow a
	large number of concurrent users.  <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> is
	actually two machines, one currently located in Denmark and
	the other in the United States.  It is
	<emphasis>NOT</emphasis> a master site and should never be
	used to mirror from.  Lots of online documentation leads
	<quote>interactive</quote>users to <systemitem class="fqdomainname">ftp.FreeBSD.org</systemitem> so
	automated mirroring systems should find a different machine to
	mirror from.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">Additionally there exists a hierarchy of mirrors, which is
	described in terms of <emphasis>tiers</emphasis>.  The master
	sites are not referred to but can be described as
	<emphasis>Tier-0</emphasis>.  Mirrors that mirror from these
	sites can be considered <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>, mirrors
	of <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis>-mirrors, are
	<emphasis>Tier-2</emphasis>, etc.  Official sites are
	encouraged to be of a low <emphasis>tier</emphasis>, but the
	lower the tier the higher the requirements in terms as
	described in <xref linkend="mirror-requirements"/>.  Also
	access to low-tier-mirrors may be restricted, and access to
	master sites is definitely restricted.  The
	<emphasis>tier</emphasis>-hierarchy is not reflected by DNS
	and generally not documented anywhere except for the master
	sites.  However, official mirrors with low numbers like 1-4,
	are usually <emphasis>Tier-1</emphasis> (this is just a rough
	hint, and there is no rule).</para>

      <para>An interesting question, especially, since the state of

      <para>Before applying, please consider (again) if another
