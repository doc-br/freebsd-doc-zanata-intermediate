    <para xml:lang="en">As is usual with FAQs, this document aims to cover the
      most frequently asked questions concerning the FreeBSD mailing
      lists (and of course answer them!).  Although originally intended
      to reduce bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked
      over and over again, FAQs have become recognized as valuable
      information resources.</para>

     <para xml:lang="en">This document attempts to represent a community consensus, and
       as such it can never really be <emphasis>authoritative</emphasis>.
       However, if you find technical errors within this document, or
       have suggestions about items that should be added, please either
       submit a PR, or email the <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-doc">FreeBSD documentation project mailing list</link>.  Thanks.</para>

	<question xml:id="purpose">
	  <para xml:lang="en">What is the purpose of the FreeBSD mailing lists?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">The FreeBSD mailing lists serve as the primary
	   communication channels for the FreeBSD community, covering many
	   different topic areas and communities of interest.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="audience">
	  <para xml:lang="en">Who is the audience for the FreeBSD mailing lists?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">This depends on charter of each individual list.  Some
	    lists are more oriented to developers; some are more oriented
	    towards the FreeBSD community as a whole.  Please see <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo">this list</link>
	    for the current summary.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="participation-who">
	  <para xml:lang="en">Are the FreeBSD mailing lists open for anyone to participate?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">Again, this depends on charter of each individual list.
	    Please read the charter of a mailing list before you post to it,
	    and respect it when you post.  This will help everyone to have
	    a better experience with the lists.</para>

	  <para xml:lang="en">If after reading the above lists, you still do not know
	    which mailing list to post a question to, you will probably
	    want to post to freebsd-questions (but see below, first).</para>

	  <para xml:lang="en">Also note that the mailing lists have traditionally
	    been open to postings from non-subscribers.  This has
	    been a deliberate choice, to help make joining the FreeBSD
	    community an easier process, and to encourage open sharing
	    of ideas.  However, due to past abuse by some individuals,
	    certain lists now have a policy where postings from
	    non-subscribers must be manually screened to ensure that
	    they are appropriate.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="subscribe">
	  <para xml:lang="en">How can I subscribe?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">You can use <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo">
	    the Mailman web interface</link> to subscribe to any
	    of the public lists.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="unsubscribe">
	  <para xml:lang="en">How can I unsubscribe?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">You can use the same interface as above; or,
	    you can follow the instructions that are at the
	    bottom of every mailing list message that is sent.</para>

	  <para xml:lang="en">Please do not send unsubscribe messages directly
	    to the public lists themselves.  First, this will not
	    accomplish your goal, and second, it will irritate the
	    existing subscribers, and you will probably get flamed.
	    This is a classical mistake when using mailing lists;
	    please try to avoid it.</para>

	<question xml:id="archives">
	  <para xml:lang="en">Are archives available?</para>

    <title xml:lang="en">Mailing List Etiquette</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">Participation in the mailing lists, like participation

	<question xml:id="before-posting">
	  <para xml:lang="en">What should I do before I post?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para xml:lang="en">You have already taken the most important step by
	    reading this document.  However, if you are new to FreeBSD,
	    you may first need to familiarize yourself with the
	    software, and all the social history around it, by
	    reading the numerous
	    <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/docs/books.html">books and articles</link>
	    that are available.  Items of particular interest
	    include the <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html">
	    FreeBSD Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</link> document,
	    the <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">
	    FreeBSD Handbook</link>,
	    and the articles <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/freebsd-questions/article.html">
	    How to get best results from the FreeBSD-questions mailing list</link>,

	    FreeBSD First Steps</link>.</para>

	  <para xml:lang="en">It is always considered bad form to ask a question that is
	    already answered in the above documents.  This is not because
	    the volunteers who work on this project are particularly mean
	    people, but after a certain number of times answering the same
	    questions over and over again, frustration begins to set in.
	    This is particularly true if there is an existing answer to the
	    question that is already available.  Always keep in mind that
	    almost all of the work done on FreeBSD is done by volunteers,
	    and that we are only human.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="recurring">
    <title xml:lang="en">Recurring Topics On The Mailing Lists</title>

    <para xml:lang="en">Participation in the mailing lists, like participation
      in any community, requires a common basis for communication.
      Many of the mailing lists presuppose a knowledge of the
      Project's history.  In particular, there are certain topics
      that seem to regularly occur to newcomers to the community.
      It is the responsibility of each poster to ensure that
      their postings do not fall into one of these categories.
      By doing so, you will help the mailing lists to stay on-topic,
      and probably save yourself being flamed in the process.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">The best method to avoid this is to familiarize yourself
      with the <link xlink:href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/mail/">
      mailing list archives</link>,
      to help yourself understand the background of
      what has gone before.  In this, the <link xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/search/search.html#mailinglists">
      mailing list search interface</link>
      is invaluable.  (If that method does not yield useful results,
      please supplement it with a search with your favorite major
      search engine).</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">By familiarizing yourself with the archives, not only will
      you learn what topics have been discussed before, but also how
      discussion tends to proceed on that list, who the participants
      are, and who the target audience is.  These are always good things
      to know before you post to any mailing list, not just a FreeBSD
      mailing list.</para>

    <para xml:lang="en">There is no doubt that the archives are quite extensive, and
      some questions recur more often than others, sometimes as followups
      where the subject line no longer accurately reflects the new content.
      Nevertheless, the burden is on you, the poster, to do your homework
      to help avoid these recurring topics.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="bikeshed">
    <title xml:lang="en">What Is A "Bikeshed"?</title>
      <para xml:lang="en">Literally, a <literal>bikeshed</literal> is a small outdoor
	shelter into which one may store one's two-wheeled form of
	transportation.  However, in FreeBSD parlance, the term refers to
	topics that are simple enough that (nearly) anyone can offer an
	opinion about, and often (nearly) everyone does. The
	genesis of this term is explained in more detail <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting">
	in this document</link>.  You simply must have a working
	knowledge of this concept before posting to any FreeBSD mailing
	list.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">More generally, a bikeshed is a topic that will tend to
	generate immediate meta-discussions and flames if you have
	not read up on their past history.</para>

      <para xml:lang="en">Please help us to keep the mailing lists as useful for as
	many people as possible by avoiding bikesheds whenever you can.
	Thanks.</para>
