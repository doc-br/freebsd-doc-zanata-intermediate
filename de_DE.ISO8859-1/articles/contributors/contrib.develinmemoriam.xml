    <para>Kurt Lidl (2015 - 2019; RIP 2019)</para>

    <para>Kurt first got involved with BSD while it was still a
      project at the University of California at Berkeley.  Shortly
      after personalized license plates became available in Maryland,
      he got "BSDWZRD".</para>

    <para>He began contributing to FreeBSD shortly after the
      conception of the project.  He became a FreeBSD source committer
      in October 2015.</para>

    <para>Kurt's most well known FreeBSD project was
      &man.blacklistd.8; which blocks and releases ports on demand to
      avoid DoS abuse.  He has also made many other bug fixes and
      enhancements to DTrace, boot loaders, and other bits and pieces
      of the FreeBSD infrastructure.</para>

    <para>Earlier work included the game XTank, an author on RFC 2516
      <link xlink:href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516">"A Method
	for Transmitting PPP Over Ethernet (PPPoE)"</link>, and the
      USENIX paper <link
	xlink:href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenix-winter-1994-technical-conference/drinking-firehose-multicast-usenet-news">"Drinking from the Firehose: Multicast USENET News"</link>.</para>

      very early days, contributing code to the 1.x line
      before becoming a committer.</para>

    <para>Andrey A. Chernov (1993 - 2017; RIP 2017)</para>

    <para>Andrey contributions to &os; can not be overstated. Having
      been involved for a long there is hardly an area which he did
      not touch.</para>

    <para>J&uuml;rgen Lock (2006 - 2015; RIP 2015)</para>

    <para>J&uuml;rgen made a number of contributions to &os;,
      including work on libvirt, the graphics stack, and QEMU.
      J&uuml;rgen's contributions and helpfulness were appreciated by
      people around the world.  That work continues to improve the
      lives of thousands every day.</para>

      was best known as a major contributor to &os;'s

      made major contributions to FreeBSD, the best known of which is
      the import of the &man.dtrace.1; code.  John's unique sense of
      humor and plain-spokenness either ruffled feathers or made him
      quick friends.  At the end of his life, he had moved to a rural
      area and was attempting to live with as minimal impact to the
      planet as possible, while at the same time still working in the
      high-tech area.</para>

      was an astrophysicist who made important contributions to the
      modeling of the atmospheres of both planets and comets at
      <link xlink:href="http://www.obs-besancon.fr/">l'Observatoire de
	Besan&ccedil;on</link> in Besan&ccedil;on, France.  While
      there, he participated in the conception and construction of the
      Vega tricanal spectrometer that studied Halley's Comet.  He had
      also been a long-time contributor to FreeBSD.</para>

    <para>Known to everyone as <link

      Jun-ichiro Hagino was a core researcher at the
      <link xlink:href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</link>,
      which aimed to provide IPv6 and IPsec technology in freely
      redistributable form.  Much of this code was incorporated into
      FreeBSD.  Without his efforts, the state of IPv6 on the Internet
      would be much different.</para>

    <para><link xlink:href="http://www.dbsi.org/cam/">Cameron</link>
      was a unique individual who contributed to the project despite
      serious physical disabilities.  He was responsible for a
      complete rewrite of our sound system during the late 1990s.
      Many of those who corresponded with him had no idea of his
      limited mobility, due to his cheerful spirit and willingness to
      help others.</para>

      ports such as <application>autoconf</application>,
      <application>CUPS</application>, and
      <application>python</application>.  Alan's path was not an easy
      one but his passion for FreeBSD, and dedication to programming
      excellence, won him many friends.</para>
